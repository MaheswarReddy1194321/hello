                        <h3>Footprinting and Reconnaissance</h3>
                        <p>Footprinting is the technique used for gathering information about computer systems and the entities they belong to.</p>

                        <h3>Social Engineering</h3>
                        <p>Social engineering, in the context of information security, refers to psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.</p>
                </div>

                        <h3>Network scanning</h3>
                        <p>Network scanning/enumeration is a computing activity in which usernames and info on groups, shares, and services of networked computers are retrieved.</p>
                </div>

                        <h3>DOS,DDOS</h3>
                        <p>DOS :  Denial-of-service attack is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.</p>
                        <p>DDOS : A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service or a website unavailable by overloading it with huge floods of traffic generated from multiple sources.</p>

                        <h3>Enumeration</h3>
                        <p>Enumeration belongs to the first phase of Ethical Hacking, i.e., "Information Gathering". This is a process where the attacker establishes an active connection with the victim and try to discover as much attack vectors as possible, which can be used to exploit the systems further.</p>

                        <h3>Session Hijacking</h3>
                        <p>In a session hijacking attack, the hacker steals the user's session token and uses it to access the user's account. There are several ways that an attacker can stage a session hijacking attack, such as inflicting the user's device with a malware that monitors and steals session data.</p>

                        <h3>Sql injection,csrf,xss</h3>
                        <p>Sql injection : SQL injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in which nefarious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution.</p>
                        <p>csrf : Cross-site request forgery, also known as one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts.</p>
                        <p>xss : Cross-site scripting is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy.</p>

                        <h3>Trojan</h3>
                        <p>Trojan, is any malicious computer program which misleads users of its true intent. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive wooden horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.</p>

                        <h3>Sniffing</h3>
                        <p>Sniffing is the process of monitoring and capturing all the packets passing through a given network using sniffing tools.</p>

                        <h3>IDS,IPS,Honey Pots</h3>
                        <p>IDS : An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management (SIEM) system.</p>
                        <p>IPS : An Intrusion Prevention System is a network security device that monitors network and/or system activities for malicious or unwanted behavior and can react, in real-time, to block or prevent those activities.</p>
                        <p>Honey Pots : Honeypot is an Internet-attached server that acts as a decoy, luring in potential hackers in order to study their activities and monitor how they are able to break into a system. </p>

                        <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
                        <p>Cloud computing is an information technology paradigm that enables ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, similar to a public utility.</p>
